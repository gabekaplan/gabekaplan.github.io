##About me

I am a student at McMaster University studying biochemistry with the ultimate goal of pursuing medicine.
In addition to my studies, I am a leader in the McMaster Jewish community with my local Hillel.
I am also passionate about helping students reach their potential as a tutor for high school math and science courses.

In my personal life, I enjoy reading fantasy fiction, watching anime, and playing table-top roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons.
I like to stay active by climbing and biking.
