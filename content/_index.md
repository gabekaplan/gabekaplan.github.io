## About me

I am a biochemistry student at McMaster University with plans to pursue family 
medicine. 
Alongside my studies, I volunteer in clinical settings and have research 
experience, including work on a published systematic review. 
I am also involved in student leadership and advocacy through Hillel McMaster, 
where I work on programming and community initiatives. 
In addition, I tutor high school math and science, which allows me to teach and 
mentor students from a range of backgrounds. 
Outside of school, I enjoy reading fantasy fiction, photography, tabletop 
role-playing games, and staying active through climbing and biking.
