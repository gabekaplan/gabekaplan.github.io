## About me

I am a biochemistry student at McMaster University with plans to pursue family 
medicine. Alongside my studies, I volunteer in clinical settings and have research 
experience, including work on a published systematic review. I am also involved 
in student leadership and advocacy through Hillel McMaster, where I work on 
programming and community initiatives. In addition, I tutor high school math 
and science, which allows me to teach and mentor students from a range of 
backgrounds. Outside of school, I enjoy reading fantasy fiction, photography, 
tabletop role-playing games, and staying active through climbing and biking.

My academic interests are grounded in medicine and the sciences that support it. McMaster’s biochemistry program has given me extensive exposure to laboratory work and research methods, and I’ve been able to apply that training through involvement in a systematic review examining surgical outcomes. That experience strengthened my interest in evidence-based medicine and helped me develop skills in critical reading, synthesis of literature, and collaborative research.

In parallel, I volunteer in the Surgical Specialty Clinics at Scarborough General Hospital, where I assist with patient flow, support clinic operations, and observe clinical care. Being in a clinical environment has helped me better understand how healthcare functions day to day, and has reinforced my interest in family medicine as a field that prioritizes access and patient-centered care, areas of growing need within the Canadian healthcare system.

Community involvement is an important part of my life. Through leadership roles with Hillel McMaster, I work on advocacy, professional development, and community programming. These experiences have shaped how I think about responsibility, something that carries over directly into my clinical interests.

I also work as a high school math and science tutor. Teaching allows me to break down complex ideas, adapt to different learning styles, and support students as they build confidence in their abilities. Many of the students I have tutored attended my former high school, which makes the work especially meaningful to me.

In my free time, I enjoy reading fantasy fiction (currently Brandon Sanderson), photography, and tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. I’ve served as a photographer for the McMaster Health Sciences Musical, and I value creative outlets that balance analytical work. I stay active through climbing and biking, and I value hobbies that reward problem-solving and collaboration.
