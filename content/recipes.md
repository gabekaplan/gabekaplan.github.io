### The Best Bread Machine Challah

This recipe yields 2 pounds of dough or 2 medium-size challahs. They are the
best I have ever had. My machine calls for the wet ingredients and salt to be
placed in the pan first, followed by the remaining dry ingredients. Using a
finger, make a well in the dry ingredients and add the yeast. Press dough cycle.

Servings: 3 medium challahs

**Ingredients**

- 5 large egg yolks
- ⅓ cup oil
- 1 ½ cups water
- 4 ¼ - 5 cups all-purpose or bread flour
- ½ cup plus 1 generous tablespoon sugar
- 1 ⅛ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- sesame seeds or poppy seeds

**Instructions**

1. Place the egg yolks, oil, water, flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in the bread
   machine pan, according to manufacturer’s directions. Process the ingredients
   in the dough cycle (90 minutes). Remove immediately when the machine beeps.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Divide the dough in half. Divide each piece into
   3 sections.
3. Roll each section into a long strand. Lay the three strands in front of you.
   Pinch the top ends together. Braid the dough and pinch the bottom ends
   together. Place on parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheets. Repeat
   with remaining dough. Let the challot rise covered, for 30 minutes
4. Brush the challah with beaten egg. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, poppy seeds,
   or a mixture of both. Bake for 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
