> I contributed to a systematic review examining clinical outcomes following surgical management of the discoid lateral meniscus. As part of the review team, I extracted patient, surgical, and outcome data from included studies and completed methodological quality assessments using established criteria. The review summarizes postoperative functional outcomes, complication rates, and reoperation risks across the current literature.
